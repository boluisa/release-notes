# Kubernetes Release Notes Generator

This repo contains a tool called `release-notes` and a set of library utilities at which aim to provide a simple and extensible set of tools for fetching, contextualizing, and rendering release notes for the [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) repository.

## Install

The simplest way to install the `release-notes` CLI is via `go get`:

```
go get github.com/marpaia/release-notes
```

This will install `release-notes` to `$GOPATH/bin/release-notes`. If you're new to Go, `$GOPATH` default to `~/go`, so look for the binary at `~/go/bin/release-notes`.

## Usage

To generate release notes for a commit range, run:

```
$ export GITHUB_TOKEN=a_github_api_token
$ release-notes \
  -start-sha d0a17cb4bbdf608559f257a76acfaa9acb054903 \
  -end-sha   91e7b4fd31fcd3d5f436da26c980becec37ceefe
level=info msg="fetching all commits. this might take a while..."
level=info msg="got the commits, performing rendering"
level=info msg="release notes markdown written to file" path=/var/folders/wp/6fkmvjf11gv18tdprv4g2mk40000gn/T/release-notes-048706664
```

You can also generate the raw notes data into JSON. You can then use a variety of tools (such as `jq`) to slice and dice the output:

```json
[
  {
    "text": "fixed incorrect OpenAPI schema for CustomResourceDefinition objects",
    "author": "liggitt",
    "author_url": "https://github.com/liggitt",
    "pr_url": "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/65256",
    "pr_number": 65256,
    "kinds": [
      "bug"
    ],
    "sigs": [
      "api-machinery"
    ]
  }
]
```
